# Math-Agent

A competition-grade mathematical reasoning harness built around the official Intern-S client.

The official `main.py` and `llm_client.py` files are frozen and verified byte-for-byte. Participant code is exposed through `user_agent.ReasoningAgent`.

## Architecture

`user_agent.ReasoningAgent` is a thin, thread-safe entry point. Each solve creates
an isolated session, parses and routes the problem, runs risk-sized method-orthogonal
candidates under mutually exclusive method-family contracts, checks actual
method duplicates from structured steps and capability-scoped claim evidence,
batches unresolved proof
claims through a soft-evidence VerifierSkeptic, and requires every completed
proof obligation to cite an explicitly mapped Claim and Evidence record before
lexicographic arbitration. High-risk problems can use a verified-lemma loop and
evidence-scoped repair. Lemma curation is a deterministic host service; its
inactive Prompt Contract is retained only for content review and is not used for
a production model call. Every lemma-expanded candidate is included in the same
batch Skeptic and proof-completion gates before arbitration. Final output is
deterministic; the LLM finalizer is disabled by default. Reviewed knowledge
retrieval is offline and remains disabled until a repeated ablation demonstrates
a stable benefit. Direct tool execution is the default; the optional one-shot
StdIO MCP adapter is also disabled.

The injected official client is the only model interface. No API keys, alternate
model clients, native function calling, or network retrieval are used.

## Verification

```bash
python -m compileall .
ruff check .
mypy mathforge user_agent.py
pytest -q
pytest --cov=mathforge --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
python scripts/check_coverage_gates.py
python scripts/verify_content_reviews.py
python scripts/verify_baseline_files.py
python scripts/validate_submission.py
pip check
git diff --check
```

Rebuild the reviewed offline FTS5 database atomically with
`python scripts/build_rag.py`. Retrieval distinguishes matched, no-match,
missing-database, unavailable-FTS, and query-error outcomes. A `verified`
knowledge card additionally requires two distinct verification reviewers.

Run any A0–A10 overlay with an explicit public model identifier:

```bash
python scripts/run_benchmark.py --input cases.jsonl --config config/ablation/A4.json --output benchmark-results/A4.json --repetitions 5 --seed 23 --model-identifier public-model-name
python scripts/verify_benchmark_artifact.py benchmark-results/A4.json
```

Create a wheelhouse and prove a clean no-index installation with
`python scripts/verify_offline_install.py --prepare-wheelhouse`, or verify a
pre-existing wheelhouse with
`python scripts/verify_offline_install.py --wheelhouse /path/to/wheelhouse`.
The first form needs network access only while preparing the temporary
wheelhouse; installation and the smoke test are offline.

## Runtime configuration

- `MATHFORGE_MODEL_MAX_CONCURRENCY`: bounded shared client concurrency (default `4`).
- `MATHFORGE_USE_MCP=1`: explicitly opt into the one-shot local StdIO adapter;
  Direct remains the production default.

Per-problem defaults are four model calls, 24,000 estimated output tokens, a
12-minute soft deadline, a 13-minute exploration cutoff, and a 14.5-minute hard
finalization deadline. Every failure path returns a non-empty deterministic fallback.
Each result also carries structured call/token/outcome metrics independently of
the bounded judge trace, plus versioned code/config/prompt/skill/RAG/tool/model
provenance. Runtime failures expose only stable safe error codes in the judge
response. Local diagnostics are opt-in through an injected
`InMemoryDebugSink` or `JsonlDebugSink`; neither is enabled by the public entry
point.

The competition profile intentionally remains `candidate-unvalidated`. Content
hashes have engineering review, but human signatures and representative
repeated A0–A10 evidence are still required before S6 can freeze the profile.
